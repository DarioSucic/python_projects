# Quadtrees

---


A basic class-based Quadtree implementation in Python with a graphical showcase of the result. This particular implementation is quite memory inefficient and slow, and is only useful as a demo.


**Usage**:

To run the visual demo, simply run one of the Python files. Two examples are provided, one showing a contracting sine wave, and the other being a simple painting program.

```cmd

python.exe quadtree_paint.py
python.exe quadtree_sine.py

```

  

```sh

python3 ./quadtree_paint.py
python3 ./quadtree_sine.py

```
  

**Dependencies**:

```sh

pip install numpy

pip install pyglet

```


Numba is also a requirement in the numba version of quadtree_sine.

```sh

pip install numba

```
